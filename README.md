### Linked-List

The aim of this project was to create an application that keeps tracks of links- read, unread, and total amount of links- that acts as a bookmark list. 
The application features input boxes for the title of the website that one wants to keep track of and the actual URL for the website. There are buttons to create a bookmark and remove all bookmarks that have been marked as 'read'. When the user creates a bookmark, there are buttons created to mark the bookmark as 'read' or to remove the bookmark entirely. All buttons toggle a counter at the bottom of the page to help the user keep track of how many total, read, and unread links/bookmarks there are.
The application will alert the user if they have input an invalid URL, but will still allow the user to create the card.
